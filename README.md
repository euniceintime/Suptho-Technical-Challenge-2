# Introduction

The challenge was to show millions of data from AWS Cloud. For storing data I have used dynamoDB and for function implementation we have used Lambda(AWS). For showing data in table I have used mdbootsrap data table with filtering and pagination option. Amazon Web Services have been used for this challenge.
